## Primary Responsibilities:
 Stephanie and Irene


1. Team discussed what elements we would like to include on dashboard (if possible)
    - Map (focus) with slider for time
    - "Baseball Card"
    - US Summary/Purpose
    - graphs (2-3) - Based on Findings
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - filters
    - layers
=======
>>>>>>> develop
2. Created Blueprint

3. Created mock dashboard on Tableau with placeholder images
<img src= "dashboard_practice.png"></img>
4. Created skeleton for JS Web Dashboard if data/group decides to use
5. Created 
combined_features_PCA3_K5.csv with all features included and totals for Primary Energy and Disaster Columns for visualization.
6. Updated file to be used for visualizations "combined_features.csv" to read
<<<<<<< HEAD
7. Decided to use Tableau because Tableau provides a variety of graphs and charts. It provides a lot of features such as layers and filters that we want to utilize in order to best visual our results. It suits our needs of the project to be able to easily combine geographical (mapped) data with charts of our feature variables.

- The dashboard below showcases the climate change trends in the United States over time. The graphs highlight the features; location, population, CO2 emissions, GDP, natural disasters, energy consumption, and renewable energy that a help predict temperature. Based on our machine learning model and accuracy, we have found that location and geographical features are key indicators in predicting temperature. On the other hand, features like natural disasters has little to no effect on temperature. The interactive map clearly shows that states closer to the equator are warmer in comparsion to those that are further away.

- The dashboard below showcases a breakdown of features based on the state. The prupose of the analysis is to discover if some states are exacerbating climate climate based on human impact. The dashboard enables users to compare states against each other. Users can compare CO2 emissions, average temperature, energy usage, and natural disasters.

- The dashboard below reflects the features that effect CO2 emissions. When our machine learning model targets CO2 emssions, we noticed a strong correlation between our features and CO2 emissions. This dashboard compares which features have a strongest correlation.
