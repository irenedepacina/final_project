## Selected Topic
Climate change by State

## Rationale:
Dataset availability
US is one of the largest emitters of CO2 in developed countries.
Population density and land mass lends itself to analysis
Climate change is an interesting topic with lot of available data.

## Discovery Questions
-	Climate Change (Temperature) trends over time by state
-	State by state environmental impact
-	Are states experiencing climate change equally?
-	Does Political leaning influence states climate change status?
-  Human impact on the US on climate change?
- Are some states exacerbating climate change through consumption patterns?

Political Leadership/State/Year

Will have to map the constituency, party national level data … data is present from 1788 to 2016 for US - fyi it seems like it has other countries of the world

Primary Industry/State/Year
https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/ -- same link by sector xl sheet doesnt have year wise breakup
Per capita energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by state (1990–2018) - looks good with state and year


GDP/State/Year

--also has industry data
